# inverseDistanceFringe
OpenFOAM-v2006 overset digging holes to fringe

This lib is implemented under the desire that I want the HOLE cells to be further away from the wall patches. 
The version of OpenFOAM is v2006. Downald the files and wmake directly. 

Usageï¼šadd libs (oversetIDFringe) to the head of controlDict file. Set oversetInterpolation to be inverseDistanceFringe and add "nPushBack 2"(or just by default 2).
